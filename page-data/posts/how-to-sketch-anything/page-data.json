I don&#39;t have an inborn talent for this. I only have a good eye for beauty from my experience as a user interface designer, but nothing more.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&quot;How did you learn to draw?&quot;, you may ask. Hmm, I just got my hands on a book and I start drawing things. If you want to draw, you should start practice right now. I downloaded an amazing book (</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">) and I was ready to challenge myself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Read, read, read</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Page after page, chapter after chapter and I finally found the secret. To draw something you have to see it &lsquo;&ldquo;right&rdquo;. Well, it doesn&#39;t sound so revealing, but it&#39;s god damn true. We are used to perceiving things based on simple symbols learned from childhood, and every single time when we try to draw something, we draw that symbol instead. To draw something you have to free your mind from these thoughts and give yourself the freedom to represent the images as you see.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The mind workout</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I found in this book some exercises to train my mind to see things in a certain way. First of them is to draw a subject upside-down. If we don&rsquo;t know what we are drawing we will not try to use our learned symbols. The second one is to draw without looking at the paper. This will help with the perception of edges and curves. And the last one that I tried was to see through a small window frame to know where the limits of the picture are. I practised these three exercises for a few times and now it&rsquo;s easier than never to draw almost anything, at least in a pleasable way.</span></p><p><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 595px;\"><img alt=\"Portrait drawing\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dib\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/725b6d20-eebf-11ea-a3de-692d5982216c-jack-chung-drkkTqbqq4-unsplash.jpg\"><span class=\"fr-inner\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kednk?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Jack Chung</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crayon-drawing?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some cool effects that I experienced</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After some time, I found out that &nbsp;I&rsquo;m more aware of things around me. I see them in a way that I never experienced before. The shift to the right side of the brain can take you in a mindful state, you become aware of every line and shape. Very cool, if you ask me!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, I found out that drawing is so relaxing. It helped me to control my stress and anxiety during the day, and if I draw before going to bed, I manage to sleep better.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And finally, you can show off in front of your friends and maybe guide them to see the things as you do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The proof</span></strong></p><p><img alt=\"Three drawings, from left to right:  a girl with two pistols, a samurai and a horseman\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/06f26870-eec1-11ea-a3de-692d5982216c-draws.jpg\"></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I&#39;ll let here some samples from my training to inspire you to read this book and try something out by yourself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#39;Till next time!</span></p>","title":"How to sketch anything?","created":"August 06, 2020","metadata":{"description":"As a child your drawings were amazing.

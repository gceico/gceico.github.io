Besides that, every single time when I could start it I was like&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&quot;Nah, there is no time for this, I have more important things to do right now&quot;.</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;Well, that sucked! This thought is a dream killer and I don&#39;t know about you, but it killed a few of mine.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">What changed, you may ask</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hmm, a few months ago when the pandemic was declared, I moved back home because it was a safer place than&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cluj-Napoca</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;which is one of the biggest cities in&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Romania</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. In the comfort of my home, I managed to work on my good habits and one of them was&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&quot;Build that God damn blog and write some posts&quot;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">But where to start?</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One will say with the beginning but in a vast landscape of web technologies and opportunities, I felt helpless. Thanks to the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://education.github.com/pack\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Github Student Pack</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;I managed to get a free domain from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Namecheap</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;and my adventure was set. I also decided to host my website on&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Github Pages</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;and use&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cloudflare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;for security,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DDoS</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;and caching solutions, also they offer a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">free SSL certificate</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;which will make any website&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HTTPS</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;instantly.</span></p><p><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 595px;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/27f099e0-c944-11ea-b44f-f5c7da208e23-andrew-neel-fGvXxVxmTi8-unsplash.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dib\" alt=\"In this photo you can find a man who is reading from his laptop\"><span class=\"fr-inner\" contenteditable=\"true\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@andrewtneel?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Andrew Neel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/confused?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></span></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What I didn&#39;t know right away is that the most difficult decision is to choose a well-suited technology for my needs. There are thousands of ways of creating a blog. From the titans like&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">WordPress</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Joomla</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Drupal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;to new and fast solutions like&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jekyll</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hugo</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gatsby</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. I have some experience with WordPress, but I can&#39;t say it is one of my favorites, and besides that, I want a fast and reliable technology. I played with&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jekyll</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;for a few hours and I was amazed how simple it can be and how fast I managed to create some pages. With a few markdowns, some templates, and a touch of&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jekyll sorcery</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;the website looks great. But something wasn&#39;t right.</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;I have to get a bit dirty to feel that I&#39;m learning something new.</span></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Later I heard about Gatsby from a friend of mine who managed to create a personal website from scratch.&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">React</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;is&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">my first love</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;when it comes to front-end libraries and luckily it is the foundation of Gatsby. I was impressed by Gatsby&#39;s features which include multiple&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CMS integrations</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;like&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cosmicjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">CosmicJS</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Netlify</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, nice Image processors that will make any image web-optimized, lazy-loading, the power of React, build to static content, well suited for&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, shall I continue?</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Let&#39;s get the job done!&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I cloned a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gatsby starter blog</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;that is integrated with CosmicJS CMS, I did some small configurations and with a few commands, my website was exposed locally.</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;Yes! It works smoothly, it&#39;s fast and I&#39;m comfortable enough with React to make it my own.</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;I created some buckets in CosmicJS and some posts and with the help of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://graphql.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GraphQL</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, I was able to use that data on my website. I installed&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gatsby-Image</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;plugin which helped me to optimize all the images from the website, I installed&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Helmet</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;which is great for SEO and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Styled Components</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;to make it look awesome.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">It&#39;s all about Design</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I&#39;m an experienced designer with some nice additions to my portfolio,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">but I never felt this lack of inspiration.</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;It&#39;s harder than I thought to design something for myself, way harder than all the projects I had. I tried a few ideas but they felt</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;too corporate-like</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, I need something with a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">touch of creativity</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, something that says &quot;This is me&quot;.</span></p><p><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 595px;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/5f8014d0-c944-11ea-b44f-f5c7da208e23-med-badr-chemmaoui-gddVLbKt79w-unsplash.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" alt=\"This photos presents a gray laptop on the table\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dib\"><span class=\"fr-inner\" contenteditable=\"true\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@medbadrc?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Med Badr &nbsp;Chemmaoui</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/user-interface?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></span></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With a spike of creativity and self-control, I was able to think outside the box which led to a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">bold, modern UI that felt mine</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">! For the&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">logo</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;I decided the use a handwritten font that gives a nice touch of personality and a square shape that says I&#39;m serious, I can be trusted and I will get the job done. The curved font is there to emphasize my creativity and the fact that sometimes I&#39;m a bit messy and not too organized.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">What&#39;s next?</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From now on I will focus on the content and maybe I will write 2 posts per month. Another thing I&#39;m going to do is to install&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hotjar</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;for UI improvements.&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hotjar</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;can offer very <strong>i</strong></span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>nteresting</strong></span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;insights about the behavior of users&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">on the platform and I can run the</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;AB tests easily</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Later I will use&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Analytics</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;to see who is my audience and how to improve my posts.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\">That&#39;s all folks!</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It was a nice adventure and I learned a few things. Later I used this knowledge in a project for work and I did a great job! Stay around if you like my content and I&#39;ll be here with new stuff every two weeks.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Hero photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kalvisuals?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">KAL VISUALS</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/computer-lap?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>","title":"How I made a blog during Covid-19 Quarantine?

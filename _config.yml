# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    Javascript, UI/UX and programming â€“ not necessarily in this order. 
    Started as a front-end developer on his own way of exploring new technologies, 
    turned into a designer driven to create eye-catching interfaces. I'm in love with design, 
    literature, photography and art and between those I find myself brewing a cup of coffee or tea.
baseurl: '' # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: 'https://gceico.me' # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

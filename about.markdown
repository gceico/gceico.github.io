Javascript, UI/UX and programming â€“ not necessarily in this order. Started as a front-end developer on his own way of exploring new technologies, turned into a designer driven to create eye-catching interfaces. I'm in love with design, literature, photography and art and between those I find myself brewing a cup of coffee or tea.
